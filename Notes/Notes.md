# Comprehensive Notes on Quantum Computing Workshop

## Fundamental Concepts in Quantum Computing

"We couldn't build quantum computers unless the universe were quantum and computing. We can build such machines because the universe is storing and processing information in the quantum realm. When we build quantum computers, we're hijacking that underlying computation in order to make it do things we want: little and/or/not calculations. We're hacking into the universe."

## Context and Historical Perspective

There are many theories on precisely how scientific understanding has progressed over time but, however you view it, looking backwards does give us a fresh view on how to view the present.

Placing the development of quantum computers in the wider context of the history of computing gives a sense of the enormity of the engineering challenges that we overcome in the past and provides a moderated but positive view on the outlook for our collective ability to develop useful quantum computers.

## Scientific Progress Perspective

"Everything is theoretically impossible, until it is done. One could write a history of science in reverse by assembling the solemn pronouncements of highest authority about what could not be done and could never happen."
- Robert Heinlein, American Science Fiction Author

## Short History of Classical Computing

### Early Computing
- **Abacus**: Early calculation tool
- **Analytical Engine**: Designed by Babbage; though he didn't finish building the device, it has since been proven that it would have worked
- **Ada Lovelace**: First to recognize that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation; published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine; widely regarded as the first to recognize the full potential of computers and one of the first computer programmers

### Development Timeline
- **Turing Machine (1936)**: Alan Turing presented the idea of a universal machine capable of computing anything that is computable; central concept of all modern computing was based on his ideas

- **Punch card system**: Used to calculate the 1890 census (in 1890); saved the government $5 million; established the company that ultimately became IBM

## Timeline of Classical Computing

### Vacuum tubes (1940s-1950s)
- Used in the late 1940s as a way of controlling electric current to represent bits
- Unwieldy, unreliable devices that overheated and required replacing
- The first general-purpose digital computer, the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC) was built in 1943
- Had 18,000 vacuum tubes
- Computers of this generation could only perform single tasks, and they had no operating system

### Transistors (1950s onwards)
- In 1951 the first computer for commercial use was introduced to the public: the Universal Automatic Computer (UNIVAC 1)
- In 1953 the IBM 650 and 700 series computers were released and (relatively) widely used

### Integrated circuits (1960s to 1970s)
- An integrated circuit is a set of electronic circuits on one small flat piece of semiconductor material (typically silicon)
- These were first developed and improved in the late 1950s and through the 1960s
- Although Kilby's integrated circuit (pictured) was revolutionary, it was fashioned out of germanium, not silicon
- About six months after Kilby's integrated circuit was first patented, Robert Noyce, who worked at Fairchild Semiconductor, recognized the limitations of germanium and created his own chip fashioned from silicon
- Fairchild's chips went on to be used in the Apollo missions, including the moon landing

### Microprocessors and beyond (1970s onwards)
- In the 1970s the entire central processing unit started to be included on a single integrated circuit or chip and became known as microprocessors
- These were a big step forward in facilitating the miniaturization of computers and led to the development of personal computers, or "PCs"
- Today's computers are a story of further abstraction including the development of software and middleware and miniaturization (with the development of smaller and smaller microprocessors)

## Quantum Computing Timeline

Quantum Mechanics as a branch of physics began with a set of scientific discoveries in the late 19th Century and has been in active development ever since. Most people will point to the 1980s as the start of physicists actively looking at computing with quantum systems.

### Key Milestones:

- **2019**: Google claims the achievement of quantum supremacy. Quantum supremacy was termed by John Preskill in 2012 to describe when quantum systems could perform tasks surpassing those in the classical world

## Moore's Law

Moore's Law is the observation that the number of transistors in a microchip doubles about every two years. It's an empirical observation and projection of a historical trend in computing.

- Originally proposed by Gordon Moore (co-founder of Intel and Fairchild Semiconductor International, Inc.) in 1965
- More transistors means more computing power, higher efficiency, and more complex functions
- Moore's Law has held true for more than 50 years
- It's the basic business model for the semiconductor industry

## Neutral Atoms in Quantum Computing

- **Definition**: Neutral atoms are atoms with an equal number of protons and electrons, resulting in no net electric charge.
- **Key characteristics**:
  - The balance of positive charges from protons and negative charges from electrons means neutral atoms do not exhibit electrical charge, distinguishing them from ions.
  - Neutrons, while not affecting the charge, contribute to the stability of the nucleus, allowing neutral atoms to maintain their structure.
  - All elements in the periodic table can exist as neutral atoms when they have equal numbers of protons and electrons (examples: hydrogen with 1 proton and 1 electron, carbon with 6 protons and 6 electrons).

## The Quantum Stack

The quantum stack represents the hierarchical structure of quantum computing systems, organized from the most fundamental level up to applications:

1. **Qubit** (Bottom level): The fundamental unit of quantum information
2. **Quantum Gates**: Manipulate qubits to perform operations
3. **Quantum Circuits**: Combinations of quantum gates
4. **Quantum Algorithms and Protocols**: Sequences of operations to solve problems
5. **Applications** (Top level): Real-world use cases of quantum computing

## Quantum Gates

Quantum gates are fundamental operations that manipulate qubits to perform quantum computations. They have the following characteristics:

- Manipulate qubits to change their state
- Perform quantum operations to enable quantum computations
- The computations can be visualized on a Bloch sphere
- Example shown: Binary transformation from 01100 to 111011

## Properties of Quantum Gates

All quantum gates share four essential properties:

1. **Unitary**: Quantum gates are represented by unitary matrices, meaning they preserve the inner product of quantum states. For a gate U, the condition U†U=UU†=I holds, where U† is the conjugate transpose of U and I is the identity matrix.

2. **Reversibility**: For every unitary matrix, there exists a conjugate U = U†.

3. **Linearity**: Quantum gates must be linear operators to maintain the integrity of quantum states. For any complex numbers a and b, and any quantum states |ψ⟩ and |φ⟩, the following property holds: U(a|ψ⟩+b|φ⟩)=aU|ψ⟩+bU|φ⟩, where U is the unitary matrix representing the quantum gate.

4. **Tensor Product**: The state of the composite system is given by the tensor product |ψ⟩⊗|φ⟩. For n qubits, the dimensionality of the composite system is 2^n, as each qubit contributes a factor of 2.

## Pauli Gates

Pauli gates are fundamental single-qubit quantum gates:

**Pauli X Gate**:
- Rotates the qubit around x-axis by 180°
- Changes from |0⟩ to |1⟩ and vice-versa

**Pauli Y Gate**:
- Rotates the qubit around y-axis by 180°
- Changes from |1⟩ to -i|0⟩ and vice-versa

**Pauli Z Gate**:
- Rotates the qubit around z-axis by 180°
- Changes from |+⟩ to |-⟩ and vice-versa

Note: There appears to be a reference to a gate with "no rotation" at the bottom of the Pauli gates slide.

## Phase Shift Gates

Phase shift gates are single-qubit gates that modify the phase of quantum states:

- Consists of a set of single-qubit gates which convert the basis states |0⟩ ↦|0⟩ and |1⟩ ↦eiφ|1⟩

**Hadamard Gate (H)**:
- Rotates the qubit 90° around y-axis then 180° around x-axis
- Changes from 0 to |+⟩ and from 1 to |-⟩ and vice-versa

Based on the images you've shared from your quantum computing workshop at IIT Delhi's Rendezvous '24 event, I'll compile comprehensive notes on the fundamental quantum gates and concepts presented in the slides.


## Quantum Gates

### X-Gate
- The X Gate gives the opposite of the input
- Behaves like your classical NOT gate
- When applied to |0⟩, it produces |1⟩
- When applied to |1⟩, it produces |0⟩
- Represented as a square with "X" inside in circuit diagrams
- Flips the state of a qubit, similar to how a NOT gate flips classical bits

### H-Gate (Hadamard Gate)
- The H Gate puts the qubit in a state of superposition
- When applied to |0⟩, it produces |+⟩
- When applied to |1⟩, it produces |-⟩
- Creates a uniform superposition of states
- Fundamental for creating quantum parallelism
- Represented as a square with "H" inside in circuit diagrams

### Z-Gate
- The Z Gate flips the superposition state of qubit
- When applied to |-⟩, it produces |+⟩
- When applied to |+⟩, it produces |-⟩
- Applies a phase shift to the qubit
- Represented as a square with "Z" inside in circuit diagrams

## Quantum Circuits

- Combination of various quantum gates put together and operate on a single or multiple qubits makes up quantum circuit
- Each qubit is given a label to start with
- Quantum circuits are built by applying gates in sequence to manipulate qubits
- Circuit identities show equivalent combinations of gates:
  * HZH is equivalent to X
  * YXY is equivalent to X
  * ZYZ is equivalent to -X (negative X)
- These circuit identities help in reducing circuit complexity and noise

## Basis of Quantum Physics

- Classical physics categorized all objects as either waves or particles
- Quantum physics introduced concepts like:
  * Schrödinger's cat - simultaneously "ALIVE" and "DEAD" until observed
  * Wave-particle duality illustrated with humorous memes
  * Superposition concepts

## Particle vs Waves

- Discrete place existence (particles) vs Continuous spread existence (waves)
- Particles interact while waves interfere (add up/cancel)
- In the 18th century, objects were restricted to classification as either waves or particles
- Quantum physics challenged this binary classification

## Applications Stack

- Hierarchy from basic to complex:
  * Qubit (foundational element)
  * Quantum Gates (basic operations)
  * Quantum Circuits (combinations of gates)
  * Quantum Algorithms and Protocols (applications of circuits)

## Historical Context

### Seeds of Quantum Mechanics in the 17th Century
- The understanding of light played a crucial role in the development of quantum mechanics
- Newton's point of view was majorly accepted because of his pronouncement
- Nobody followed Huygens' claim of light being a disturbance in the medium
- In 1801, the Young's Double Slit (YDS) experiment challenged Newton's theory of light and brought attention to Huygens' wave model

## Wave-Particle Duality

- **Wave-Particle Duality** is considered the most important property of Quantum Mechanics
- Each electron appears as a discrete spot on the wall, but these discrete spots arrange themselves in an interference pattern
- This fundamental quantum behavior shows matter exhibiting both particle and wave properties simultaneously
- The presentation shows an interactive demonstration with options to select "particle," "wave," "quantum object," or "add an observer"

## Quantum Wave Function Characteristics

### Most Important Characteristics of a Wave in Quantum Wave Function:

1. **Amplitude of quantum wave function**
   - Indicates how likely it is to be measured
   
2. **Phase of quantum wave function**
   - How shifted it is relative to another wave
   - The phase plays an important role in interference
   
## Quantum Computing Concepts

### Phase & Amplitude in Quantum Computing
- Quantum computers can solve problems by using phase difference to increase the amplitude of solutions
- The foundation of quantum computing relies on:
  - **|0⟩** (zero state, represented with an up arrow)
  - **|1⟩** (one state, represented with a down arrow)
  - **Superposition** (combination of states, represented with both up and down arrows)

### Understanding Different Qubit States
- Basic qubit states include:
  1. **|0⟩** - The zero state (shown with probability distribution)
  2. **|1⟩** - The one state (shown with probability distribution)
  3. **Superposition** - Combination of both states
  4. **|+⟩** - Plus state (shown with distribution labeled 0 and 1)
  5. **|-⟩** - Minus state (shown with distribution, with negative amplitude)

### Interpreting Amplitudes (Coefficients)
- Combining |+⟩ and |-⟩ states
- Adjusting coefficients so that they cancel out each other
- Interpreting amplitude to determine how likely it is to be measured in that state
- Taking an experiment to count the number of times 0 and 1 appear by making multiple superpositions and finding probability
- Note: "Quantum Measurement collapses wave-function"

## Born's Rule

Born's Rule allows us to predict the probability of measuring each state of a quantum object.

For a qubit, Born's rule states:
- |state⟩ = a*|0⟩ + b*|1⟩
- Probability of measuring |0⟩ = a²
- Probability of measuring |1⟩ = b²

Note: |a|² + |b|² = 1, where a & b are probability amplitudes

Born's rule applies to both:
- |1⟩ and |0⟩ states
- |+⟩ and |-⟩ states

## Quantum Notation Elements

### Bra-Ket Notation
- |a⟩: ket
- ⟨b|: bra
- ⟨b|a⟩: inner product

### Bracket Inner Product
- ⟨b|a⟩ = a₁b₁* + a₂b₂* = ⟨a|b⟩*

### Ket-Bra Outer Product
- |a⟩⟨b| = (a₁b₁* a₁b₂*
             a₂b₁* a₂b₂*)

### Superposition
- a|0⟩ + b|1⟩
- a² = Pr(0)
- b² = Pr(1)
- a → amplitude of 0
- b → amplitude of 1

## Multi-Qubit Circuits

The most common multi-qubit gate is CNOT / Controlled X gate.

### CNOT Gate Operation:
- Shows interaction between 2 qubits
- q0: control qubit
- q1: target qubit

#### When control qubit (q0) = |0⟩:
- CX gate does nothing to the target qubit
- The circuit remains unchanged

#### When control qubit (q0) = |1⟩:
- CX gate applies X gate to the target qubit
- X gate is applied to q1

## Creating Entanglement

- State of 1 qubit would be controlled by a superposition of the other qubit
- This leads to entanglement as one system becomes deeply related to the other through quantum mechanical properties

### Entanglement Creation Process:
1. Apply Hadamard gate to q0
2. Apply CNOT gate
3. Result: qubits are entangled

"This circuit creates ENTANGLEMENT!"

## Toffoli / CCNOT Gate

The Toffoli gate, also known as the CCNOT gate (controlled-controlled-NOT), is a fundamental three-qubit quantum gate with important properties and applications in quantum computation.

Components:
- q0: control qubit
- q1: control qubit
- q2: target qubit

### CCNOT Gate Operation:
- If control qubits (q0 or q1 or both) = |0⟩:
  * CX gate does nothing to the target qubit
  
- If control qubits (q0 and q1) = |1⟩:
  * CX gate applies X gate to the target qubit q2

I'll create comprehensive notes based on the images you've shared from the quantum computing workshop. Here's a detailed summary of the content:

### SWAP Gate
- Exchanges values of two qubits
- Can be implemented using 2 CNOT gates
- Representation shows |0⟩ and |1⟩ states swapping positions
- Swap can also be implemented with Hadamard gates and CZs (Controlled-Z gates)

- Achieves quadratic speedup compared to classical search methods
- Requires only O(√N) evaluations of the function, where N is the size of the search space

**Algorithm Steps**:
1. **Initialization**: Begin by initializing qubits to a uniform superposition of all possible states
2. **Grover Iteration**: Core of the algorithm involves repeating a "Grover iteration" that consists of:
   - Applying an oracle function (to mark the correct solution)
   - Applying a diffusion operator (to amplify the probability of the correct state)
3. **Measurement**: After a predetermined number of iterations, qubits are measured to yield the desired output with high probability

**Applications**:
- Cryptographic key searches
- NP-complete problems that involve exhaustive search
- Particularly useful in scenarios where classical algorithms would require exponential time

### Shor's Algorithm
- **Purpose**: Quantum algorithm for integer factorization
- Efficiently finds prime factors of a composite number
- Poses significant threat to classical encryption methods, particularly RSA
- Can factor large numbers in polynomial time, unlike classical algorithms that run in exponential time

**Algorithm Steps**:
1. **Reduction**: Begins by reducing the factoring problem to finding the order of an integer modulo a composite number
2. **Quantum Period Finding**: Utilizes quantum techniques to find the period efficiently, leveraging principles of superposition and interference
3. **Classical Post-Processing**: Uses classical computation to derive the factors from the period information obtained through the quantum part of the algorithm

**Applications**:
- Has profound implications for cryptography
- Can break widely used public-key cryptosystems based on the difficulty of factorization
- Has led to increased interest in post-quantum cryptography, which aims to develop encryption methods secure against quantum attacks
